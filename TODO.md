- Make a proper `else` block for the `SwitchDiscriminant` LLVM IR.
- Add an assert that the `ctx.func.func.source_file` comes from a specific "intrinsics" module inside LLVM IR creation of compiler intrinsics.
- Decide what terms to use for high level constructs: project, package, module, crate, binary...?
- Maybe add a keyword to hint to the compiler that we want heap allocation on a specific variable.
- Convert `LLVMStructRepresentation` to a specialised `AnyTypeRepresentation` to avoid code duplication.
- Implement pattern exhaustiveness check *in MIR*.
- Try using symbol names `+, -` etc in weird places e.g. type parameters, to see what breaks.
- Remove brackets around definitions (and the `def` keyword) to make it more like other functional languages.
- Remove TypeVariable and replace with TypeVariableId wherever possible in type deduction algorithm.
- Add function/impl inlining in MIR. After this is done, we can reform the type checker for higher kinded types, since HKT impls get inlined so can codegen properly.
