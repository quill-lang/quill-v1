# Type Checking

The type checking phase uses the project index, generated by the previous step, to deduce all types of expressions inside definitions.

A Hindley-Milner-style algorithm is used, with the precise implementation customised to the language. At the moment, higher-kinded types technically work, but they are not usable yet since type classes are yet to be added to the language.

This step returns the representation of the source file in HIR, the first real intermediate representation. At this point, much of the syntactic sugar in the language has been removed to help with future steps. All types of all expressions are now known, but no monormorphisation has happened, so we might still be stuck with just knowing type variables.
